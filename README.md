# To-Do-List-App
Simple To Do List App (Idea Only, Not Being Made For Release or Commercial Use)<br />
Completly written and design by Devin Yancey. <br /> 
All files not written by me contains actual authors name in file. Please see podfiles for the list of frameworks used currently
in the project (not all frameworks are actually being used).<br />
#### Improvements that would need to be made if being made for release: <br />
 
1. More testing and research.
2. Backend for synching tasks across devices. Would love to use firebase here. 
3. Support for push notifications. Important for the user to know when tasks are due. 
4. Fix currently know bugs.
5. Finish Settings Page design.
